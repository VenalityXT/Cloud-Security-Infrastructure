Project Overview                                                           
Platform: Amazon Web Services (AWS)                                         
Tools Used: AWS EC2, VPC, IAM, Security Groups, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Terraform, and more

Objectives:                                                                
• Design and deploy a secure, scalable cloud infrastructure using AWS services.                           
• Implement secure configurations, including identity management, networking, and access controls.        
• Conduct vulnerability assessments and apply best practices to ensure data security and availability.    

Key Achievements:                                                                                         
• Deployed a multi-tier architecture with EC2 instances, RDS, and VPC for network isolation.              
• Configured AWS IAM roles and policies for least privilege access control.                               
• Implemented VPC peering and Security Groups to secure inter-service communications.                     
• Automated infrastructure deployment using Terraform scripts for repeatable provisioning.                
• Enabled CloudWatch and CloudTrail for enhanced monitoring, logging, and compliance tracking.            

Skills Developed:                                                                                         
• Cloud architecture design and implementation using AWS services.                                        
• Secure network and identity management in the cloud.                                                    
• Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform for automated provisioning.                                 
• Implementing monitoring, logging, and alerting for operational security.                                
• Best practices for securing cloud environments and mitigating common cloud-specific risks.              

Recommendations for Securing Cloud Infrastructure:                                                        
• Regularly update security groups and IAM policies to minimize access.                                   
• Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for AWS root and privileged user accounts.                        
• Enable encryption for data at rest and in transit using AWS KMS and SSL/TLS.                            
• Leverage AWS CloudTrail for auditing and monitoring all account activity.                               
• Ensure regular backups and implement disaster recovery planning for high availability.
