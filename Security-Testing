# Security Testing

## Penetration Testing
Performed basic penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities in the infrastructure, including:
- **Open ports** in security groups.
- **Misconfigured IAM roles** that could be exploited.
- **Unencrypted data** in S3 buckets.

## Findings
- Identified and remediated exposed SSH ports.
- Tightened IAM role policies to reduce access permissions.

## Recommendations
- Conduct regular security audits.
- Implement logging and monitoring for real-time threat detection.
